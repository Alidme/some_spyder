  <a name="II" style="color:black;"><b>II</b></a>: Independent inquiry. Also see <b>grad_II</b> list below.  A subject
     provides an II experience if at least 40% of the grade in a
     12-unit subject depends on a single relatively open-ended
     project. The student should be involved in defining the project.
     Projects may be done singly or in groups; they may be analytical
     or empirical in nature. They should be supervised in the sense
     that at least one milestone (proposal, outline, presentation) is
     evaluated and the student given feedback before the final

Aims to enhance knowledge and intuition about psychological processes in areas relevant to economics. Increases understanding of psychology as an experimental discipline, with its own distinct rules and style of argument. Topics include self-knowledge, cognitive dissonance, self-deception, emotions, social norms, self-control, learning, mental accounting, memory, individual and group behavior, and some personality and psycho-analytic models. Within each of these topics, we showcase effective and central experiments and discuss their role in the development of psychological theory. Term paper required.</p></div></a></td></tr></table>

The content is roughly divided into three parts. The first part is about classical regularization, margin, stochastic gradient methods, overparametrization, implicit regularization, and stability. The second part is about deep networks: approximation and optimization theory plus roots of generalization. The third part is about the connections between learning theory and the brain. Occasional talks by leading researchers on advanced research topics. Emphasis on current research topics.</p></div></a><br><a class="annotated-link next-term" href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.7930" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">6.7930<old>6.871</old><div class="annotation"><b>6.7930 Machine Learning for Healthcare</b><br><hr/> <img src="/images/grad.gif"> (<img src="/images/spring.gif">)<br>Prereqs: 6.3900, 6.4100, 6.7810, 6.7900, 6.8611, or 9.520<br>Units: 4-0-8<hr/><p>Introduces students to machine learning in healthcare, including the nature of clinical data and the use of machine learning for risk stratification, disease progression modeling, precision medicine, diagnosis, subtype discovery, and improving clinical workflows.
